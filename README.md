# Metric_Mode

_This Project is aimed at analyzing various open source systems from “The Apache Software Foundation”. The systems first undergo a data collection process under which they are subjected to various tools which collect data for different metrics. Later this collected data undergoes Correlation analysis inorder to find some rationales based on the data. By Performing this assessment, we get an idea of the overall quality of the SUT (System under test) as well as helps us to get an idea of the impacts of decision made during the software development life cycle._ 

The chosen systems undergo a rigorous analysis under different tools to measure various metrics including:  

1. Code Coverage Metric ( Statement Coverage )
2. Code Coverage Metric ( Branch Coverage )
3. Mutation Score
4. Cyclomatic Complexity ( McCabe )
5. Code Churn ( A sofware Maintainance Metric)
6. Code Smells ( A software quality metric )
