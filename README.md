# Metric_Mode



This Project is aimed at analyzing various open source systems from “The Apache Software Foundation”. By Performing this assessment, we get an idea of the overall quality of the SUT (System under test) as well as helps us to get an idea of the impacts of decision made during the software development life cycle. The chosen systems undergo a rigorous analysis under different tools to measure various metrics including

* Code Coverage
* Cyclomatic Complexity
* Mutation Score 
* Code Churn – A software Maintenance Attribute
* Code Smells- A Software Quality Attribute
